Troy Woods,President & COO,"Troy Woods, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of TSYS, has guided the company's diversification strategy into faster-growing areas of payments as TSYS moved beyond its roots as a third-party processor for a few hundred bank issuers and merchant acquirers. This included the company's entry into the direct merchant acquiring business serving hundreds of thousands of businesses and into a leading prepaid services provider, supporting millions of underserved consumers who do not have access to traditional financial services.

Woods has been the catalyst in TSYS' vision to be the leading global payments solutions provider by driving innovation to improve lives and businesses across the world by putting people at the center of payments. Under Woods leadership, the company introduced its brand promise, People-Centered Payments, which is based on the belief that payments should revolve around people, not the other way around.

Woods started his career at Columbus Bank and Trust Company (Columbus, Ga.) in 1970, working part-time in the bankcard department and eventually becoming a vice president. He left the company in 1977 to become a senior vice president for card services with United American Bank, Knoxville, TN. In 1979 he joined AmSouth Bank in Birmingham, AL, as senior vice president of Card Services, and in 1982 became senior vice president of Consumer Lending. He rejoined TSYS in 1987 and was involved in directing the company's international expansion, strategic planning activities, negotiations with major clients, and the continual improvement of TS2, the company's core issuing payments engine.

Woods is chairman of the TSYS Board of Directors, and also serves on the Board of Directors for several civic organizations as well, including the YMCA of Metropolitan Columbus (Ga.), West Georgia Honor Flight and the Greater Columbus Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees for Columbus State University and the River Center for the Performing Arts in Columbus, Georgia.

In January 2003, he assumed the position of chairman of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm located in Washington, D.C. He retired from that position in October 2008 and remains a senior advisor to Carlyle.

Before joining IBM, Gerstner served as chairman and chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco. Prior to that he served as president of the American Express Company and was a director of the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co.

A native of Mineola, New York, Gerstner received a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Dartmouth College in 1963 and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1965. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and has been awarded honorary doctorates from a number of US universities.

Gerstner is chairman of the board of directors of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; vice chairman of the board of the American Museum of Natural History; and a member of the board of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as well as chairman of the board of MSK’s Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. In past years he served on a number of boards for public companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, the New York Times, American Express, AT&T, and Caterpillar.

A lifetime advocate of the importance of quality K-12 education in America, Gerstner created The Teaching Commission in 2003 to develop specific policy recommendations to raise the stature, performance, and accountability of teachers in US schools. From 1996 to 2002, he co-chaired Achieve, an organization created by US governors and business leaders to drive high academic standards for public schools in the United States. At IBM, he established “Reinventing Education” as a strategic partnership with 21 states and school districts that utilize IBM technology and technical assistance to eliminate key barriers to school reform and improve student performance.

He has received numerous awards for his work in education, among them the Cleveland E. Dodge Medal for Distinguished Service to Education - Teachers College, Columbia University and the Distinguished Service to Science and Education award from the American Museum of Natural History. In recognition of his efforts on behalf of public education, as well as his business accomplishments, Gerstner was awarded the designation of honorary Knight of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in June 2001.

Gerstner is the author of Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance, the best-selling account of IBM’s transformation; and he is the co-author of the book Reinventing Education:  Entrepreneurship in America’s Public Schools.

In November 2004, MSK announced the establishment of the Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSK), positioning MSK as a premier training ground in cancer biology. Named in recognition of Mr. Gerstner’s commitment to MSK and his understanding of the need to narrow the gap between basic cancer research and clinical applications, GSK offers an innovative program leading to a PhD degree in cancer biology. The first class of six students matriculated in 2006 and currently more than 90 students are doing their thesis work in MSK laboratories. In May 2015, GSK graduated its fourth class of students.",ibm,d4c2niwf9htmk2sp1vli,fc5fbe7a-562d-d577-b05e-46797caa134c,organization,IBM,male

The overall Wipro group revenues are $ 9 billion.

Premji has been driven by one basic idea – to build an organization deeply committed to Values, with the firm belief that success in business eventually but inevitably follows. Unflinching commitment to Values continues to remain at the core of Wipro. Premji strongly believes that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things when organized into highly charged teams, and takes keen personal interest in developing leaders and teams.
Wipro’s business success has been driven by keeping the customer at the core of everything it does. Combining its deep expertise in technology with an equally clear understanding of customer industries, Wipro attempts to deliver business value to customers consistently. The consistency is driven by its pioneering efforts in service quality and predictability, through methodologies like Six Sigma, PCMM and Lean. The underlying tenets that drive this overall culture are that of speed, simplicity and excellence.

Premji firmly believes that business organizations have a social responsibility not only to employ ethical, fair and ecologically sensitive business practices but also to actively engage with fundamental societal issues. Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (in India) and Wipro STEM Fellowships (in the US) are initiatives deeply involved in trying to improve quality of school education, while the Wipro Cares program engages with local community causes. Mission 10X works to improve quality of engineering college education. In 2001, Premji established and personally endowed the Azim Premji Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, with a vision of enhancing quality and equity in the public school education system in India, to build a better society. The Azim Premji Foundation works in 7 states of India which have over 300,000 schools. In 2011, the Foundation established the Azim Premji University, which is focused on teaching and research programs in Education and other areas of Human Development.

Over the years, Azim Premji has received numerous honors and accolades, which he considers as recognitions for Team Wipro. BusinessWeek featured him on their cover of the October 2003 issue with the sobriquet India’s Tech King and listed him amongst the top 30 entrepreneurs in world history in July 2007. In October 2005, Financial Times included him in a global list of 25 people dramatically reshaping the way people live, work or think. Time listed him amongst the world’s 100 most influential people in April 2004 and again April 2011, citing his contribution to improving the public education system in India. He was named by Fortune (August 2003) as one of the 25 most powerful business leaders outside the US, by Forbes (March 2003) as one of ten people globally with most power to effect change, and by the Journal of Foreign Policy (November 2011) as amongst the top global thinkers.

Premji became the first Indian recipient of the Faraday Medal and has been conferred honorary doctorates by the Michigan State University and Wesleyan University (in the US), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Roorkee and Kharagpur amongst others. He is a member of the Indo-UK, Indo-French CEO forums and a member of the Indo-Japan Business Leaders’ Forum. The Republic of France bestowed upon him the Legion of Honor and Forbes India honored him with its inaugural Outstanding Philanthropist of the Year in November 2012. He was conferred in January 2011 with Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award in India. In September 2013 Premji received All India Management Association (AIMA) Managing India Award as the Corporate Citizen of the Year for his inspiring business values and his contribution to society. He was honored with the Asian Business Leaders Award by Asia House (UK) in October 2013 for his impressive business credentials and his significant efforts to inspire a commitment in others to improving society. In December 2013, Economic Times bestowed Mr. Premji with Life Time Achievement Award.",wipro,ygi0uferwwy6yie5i2f3,ac6ef54a-1f35-a468-2001-f04dd3fc035e,organization,Wipro Technologies,male

Ric co-founded Red Ventures in 2000, just days before the dot-com bubble burst. The company weathered the storm and by 2007 it was ranked 4th on the Inc. 500 list.

In 2009, Elias was a survivor of Flight 1549, an event which drastically changed his life and led to his widely viewed TED Talk “3 things I learned while my plane crashed.” Elias is cited as aspiring to create the “Google of the East Coast” within his company’s culture and facilities.

Ric's leadership style earned him noteworthy recognition in 2011, when he was named an Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year. His inspirational views on both business and family have been featured on CNN, TED Talks and MSNBC.

Ric Elias is the co-founder and CEO of Red Ventures, a portfolio of digital companies headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. With over 3,000 employees in 10 US cities, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Brazil, Red Ventures’s digital platform spans across many industries, including home services, financial services, health services, education, and entertainment. Through its influential brands, strategic partnerships, and powerful technology platform, Red Ventures connects millions of people to premium content, intuitive digital experiences, and consumer advice to help make life’s most important decisions.

Over the last decade, Red Ventures has compounded growth at over 30%. In 2010, General Atlantic made a strategic investment in the company, and in 2015 Silver Lake also joined as a shareholder. Ric has cultivated an award-winning and technology-centric company culture, ranking as one of Charlotte’s “Best Places to Work” for ten years in a row.

A native of Puerto Rico, Ric graduated from Boston College and earned his MBA from Harvard Business School. He co-founded Red Ventures in 2000, months before the dot-com bubble burst. The company weathered the storm; by 2007 it was ranked 4th on the Inc. 500 list. Ric’s leadership style has earned him noteworthy recognition; in 2011, he was named an Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year, and in 2016 he was inducted into the Carolinas Entrepreneur Hall of Fame.

In 2009, Ric survived Flight 1549, also known as the “Miracle on the Hudson,” an event which changed his life and led to his widely viewed TED Talk “3 Things I Learned While My Plane Crashed.” In 2019, he launched a podcast, “3 Things with Ric Elias,” where he shares conversations and insights with top business leaders, athletes, and remarkable guests.

In addition to being deeply committed to his family and Red Ventures, Ric is passionate about creating economic mobility opportunities for underserved groups who have the motivation and work ethic to succeed. In 2013, he founded and funded what is now Road to Hire, a 501(c)(3) that connects young adults with on-ramps to professional development and high-earning careers. Programs provided through the Road to Hire platform include career-readiness classes in Charlotte Mecklenberg Title 1 high schools, digital marketing courses at Johnson C. Smith University, on-the-job training and placement with top employers in Charlotte , and scholarships for high-performing undocumented students seeking college degrees.

The ABA is a 135 year old association that represents banks of all sizes and charters and is the voice for the nation's $13 trillion banking industry and its two million employees.
Keating became ABA's president and CEO on January 1, 2011, following seven years of service as the president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers, and after serving two terms as Oklahoma's 25th governor.

Born in St. Louis, Frank grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and a law degree from the University of Oklahoma. His 30-year career in law enforcement and public service included service as an FBI agent; U.S. Attorney and state prosecutor; and Oklahoma House and Senate member.
 
He served Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the Treasury, Justice, and Housing departments. His Justice and Treasury service gave him responsibility for all federal criminal prosecutions in the nation and oversight over agencies such as the Secret Service, U.S. Customs, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Marshals, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service and all 94 U.S. Attorneys. As assistant secretary of Treasury and general counsel and acting deputy secretary of HUD, Keating worked on banking issues that are demanding attention today—including housing finance, lending practices, securitization and Bank Secrecy Act issues.

In 1993 Keating returned to Oklahoma to run for Governor. He won a three-way race by a landslide and was easily re-elected in 1998, becoming only the second governor in Oklahoma history to serve two consecutive terms.
 
As the governor of Oklahoma, Keating won national acclaim in 1995 for his compassionate and professional handling of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. In the aftermath of the tragedy, he raised more than six million dollars to fund scholarships for the nearly 200 children left with only one or no parents. His accomplishments as Governor include winning a public vote on right-to-work, tort reform, tax cuts, and major road building and education reform.
 
Keating recently served on the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force, a group of former cabinet members, elected officials and key stakeholders of both parties that recommended a series of tough measures to address the nation's fiscal challenges. He also served on the BPC’s Housing Commission. He  has been chairman of the Advisory Board of Mt. Vernon and president of the Federal City Council. Currently he  serves on the boards of the National Archives, the Jamestown Foundation and the Bipartisan Policy Center.
 
Keating also is the author of four award-winning children's books, biographies of Will Rogers, Theodore Roosevelt, George Washington, and Standing Bear, the Ponca Indian chief who argued Native Americans deserve the same rights as white Americans. He is the recipient of six honorary degrees.",american-bankers-association,v1421127577/cf3qovdsrwanoeaby9mj.jpg,af7d023c-765d-ac91-953c-8d079ebd6151,organization,American Bankers Association,male

From there he instructed Tae Kwon Do, learning that 7 to 14 year olds are some of the toughest customers on Earth. As a bag boy (nee’ Courtesy Clerk) for Olson’s Food Stores he learned the value of a simple conversation and taking the bags out for each and every customer. “How you leave them is how they leave,” his store manager repeated and it hit a chord.

Years later, whether it was working for Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown advising companies like Ameritrade on their M&A strategy or helping WebEx pioneer and popularize the SaaS business model, Robi was lucky to always be close to customers in his roles. At Yahoo!, he spent his time with teams in product, design and sales, working closely with global CPG brands.

Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck the Biden family when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in an auto accident.

Biden was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons’ hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate. 

Biden married Jill Jacobs in 1977, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of Ashley Blazer Biden. A lifelong educator, Jill earned her doctorate in education and returned to teaching as an English professor at a community college in Virginia.

Beau Biden, Attorney General of Delaware and Joe Biden’s eldest son passed away in 2015 after battling brain cancer with the same integrity, courage, and strength he demonstrated every day of his life. Beau’s fight with cancer inspires the mission of President Biden’s life — ending cancer as we know it.

As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, President Biden established himself as a leader in facing some of our nation’s most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 16 years, Biden is widely recognized for his work writing and spearheading the Violence Against Women Act  — the landmark legislation that strengthens penalties for violence against women, creates unprecedented resources for survivors of assault, and changes the national dialogue on domestic and sexual assault.

As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He was at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and ending apartheid.

“America is an idea. An idea that is stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth, it guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity and gives hate no safe harbor. It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there’s nothing you can’t achieve if you work at it. That’s what we believe.”

As Vice President, Biden continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation and represented our country abroad. Vice President Biden convened sessions of the President’s Cabinet, led interagency efforts, and worked with Congress in his fight to raise the living standards of middle-class Americans, reduce gun violence, address violence against women, and end cancer as we know it.

Biden helped President Obama pass and then oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act — the biggest economic recovery plan in the history of the nation and our biggest and strongest commitment to clean energy. The President’s plan prevented another Great Depression, created and saved millions of jobs, and led to 75 uninterrupted months of job growth by the end of the administration. And Biden did it all with less than 1% in waste, abuse, or fraud — the most efficient government program in our country’s history.

President Obama and Vice President Biden also secured the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 20 million by the time they left office and banned insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions.

He served as the point person for U.S. diplomacy throughout the Western Hemisphere, strengthened relationships with our allies both in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and led the effort to bring 150,000 troops home from Iraq.

In a ceremony at the White House, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction — the nation’s highest civilian honor.

After leaving the White House, the Bidens continued their efforts to expand opportunity for every American with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.

On April 25, 2019, Biden announced his candidacy for President of the United States. Biden’s candidacy was built from the beginning around 3 pillars: the battle for the soul of our nation, the need to rebuild our middle class — the backbone of our country, and a call for unity, to act as One America. It was a message that would only gain more resonance in 2020 as we confront a pandemic, an economic crisis, urgent calls for racial justice, and the existential threat of climate change.",the-white-house,bekgcsagfdwxigwq8akv,65fb148f-9051-a982-4697-185c675cc21b,organization,The White House,male

Kerry was sworn in as our nation’s first Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and the first-ever Principal to sit on the National Security Council entirely dedicated to climate change. President Biden announced Kerry would have a seat at every table around the world as he combats the climate crisis to meet the existential threat that we face. In recent years, Kerry was the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s first ever Visiting Distinguished Statesman, following his four years as the 68th United States Secretary of State. As America’s top diplomat, he guided the Department’s strategy on nuclear nonproliferation, combating radical extremism, and the threat of climate change. His tenure was marked by the successful negotiation of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Climate Agreement.

From 1985 to 2013, he served as a U.S. Senator representing Massachusetts, and was Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2009 to 2013. Secretary Kerry served in the U.S. Navy, completing two combat tours of duty in Vietnam for which he received a Silver Star, a Bronze Star with Combat V, and three Purple Hearts.

Harris’ father immigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica to study economics and her mother immigrated from India. Harris’ mother told her growing up, “Don’t sit around and complain about things, do something,” which is what drives Harris every single day.

Harris started fighting for working families in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, where she focused on prosecuting child sexual assault cases. From there, she became the first Black woman elected as San Francisco’s District Attorney. In this position, she started a program to provide first-time drug offenders second chances with the opportunity to earn a high school degree and find a job.

In 2010, Harris became the first Black woman to be elected Attorney General of California, overseeing the country’s second largest Justice Department after the U.S. Department of Justice. In this capacity, she managed a $735 million budget and oversaw more than 4,800 attorneys and other employees. As California Attorney General, Harris fought for families and won a $20 billion settlement for California homeowners against big banks that were unfairly foreclosing on homes.

During her time as a U.S. Senator, Harris has introduced and co-sponsored legislation to help the middle class, increase the minimum wage to $15, reform cash bail, and defend the legal rights of refugees and immigrants.

Harris has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where she has fought to protect Americans’ civil rights, restore independence and integrity to the Justice Department, and scrutinized nominations coming before the Committee.

On the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Harris has dealt with the nation’s most sensitive national security and international threats. She also has served on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee where she has overseen the federal government’s response to natural disasters and emergencies, including the Trump administration’s response to COVID-19.

Harris graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., and earned a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law.

Harris has been married to her husband Doug Emhoff for the past six years. She is the stepmother of two children, Cole and Ella, who call her “Momala” and are her “endless source of love and pure joy.”",the-white-house,bekgcsagfdwxigwq8akv,65fb148f-9051-a982-4697-185c675cc21b,organization,The White House,female

Bloomberg is an entrepreneur and philanthropist who served three terms as Mayor of the City of New York.


In 1966, Michael R. Bloomberg was hired by a Wall Street firm, Salomon Brothers, for an entry-level job. When Salomon was acquired in 1981, he was let go from the firm. Then with a vision of an Information Technology Company, that would bring quality to the buying and selling of financial securities, Michael R. Bloomberg launched a small startup in a one room office. Today, Bloomberg Company is a global company that has more than 15,000 employees and offices in 73 countries around the world.


During his occupancy as Mayor, from 2002 through 2013, he turned around a broken public school system by raising standards and holding schools accountable for success. Michael R. Bloomberg’s economic policies helped New York City experience record-levels of private-sector job growth often in formerly depressed neighborhoods.


His passion for public health led to new strategies that became national representations, including a ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces, as well as at parks and beaches. Michael R. Bloomberg launched pioneering anti-poverty efforts, including the Young Men’s Initiative and the Center for Economic Opportunity. He launched national bi-partisan coalitions to combat illegal guns, reform immigration, and invest in infrastructure.


In addition to Bloomberg Philanthropies' five areas of focus: public health, arts and culture, the environment, education, and government innovation, Michael R. Bloomberg has continued to support projects of other importance to him, including his university, Johns Hopkins University, where he served as the chairman of the board of trustees from 1996 to 2001. The university's School of Hygiene and Public Health, the largest public health facility in the U.S., is the Bloomberg School of Public Health in recognition of his commitment and support. He has donated more than $2.4 billion to a wide variety of causes and organizations.


As chair of the C40 Climate Leadership Group from 2010 to 2013, Michael R. Bloomberg drew international attention to cities’ leading role in the fight against climate change. In 2014, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Michael R. Bloomberg to be U.N. Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change where he will focus on helping cities and countries set and achieve more climate change goals.

Today Cvent has over 4,300 employees and over 28,000 customers around the world. 

Prior to Cvent Brad was Chief Marketing Officer for Octiv (acquired by Conga), a document automation platform for sales and legal documents. From 2012-2016 Brad was Global Vice President of Marketing (CMO) for SiriusDecisions (acquired by Forrester), the leading global research and advisory firm for b-to-b sales, marketing, and product organizations. 

Prior to joining SiriusDecisions, Brad was Vice President of Marketing for the global technology solutions firm, ROLTA (BSE:ROLTA.BO), where he led marketing for the Americas, Europe and MENA regions. He was also Vice President of Marketing for Zanett, a leading mid-market business and technology consulting firm (acquired by KPMG in June 2014). 

The majority of Brad’s career has focused on go-to-market. Following the Dot Com crash in 2002 Brad co-founded MFGA where he led marketing strategy engagements for organizations in Advanced Manufacturing, Biotech, Consumer Goods, Financial Services, Software and Professional Services. While at MFGA, Brad also co-founded two start-ups based on patented technologies and serves as President or PEARL Protected.

About PEARL Protected

While at MFGA, Brad co-founded two start-ups based on patented technologies and served as President of one of those companies, PEARL Protected, from 2005-2007. PEARL gained national exposure for its unique solution for fire safety. The PEARL product is a patented escape ladder that is installed permanently into an interior wall allowing egress through a window or other opening. Following its launch in 2005, the PEARL ladder became one of the most recognized home safety products in the market. PEARL appeared on several episodes of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and was showcased on NBC's Today Show and CBS's The Early Show. In 2006 PEARL earned the Product Innovation Award from the Home Safety Council. Widely supported by fire safety professionals across the US, former California State Fire Marshall, James McMullen, referred to PEARL at the time as ""the most innovative fire safety product since the advent of the residential smoke alarm"". The National Institute of Fire and Safety Training called PEARL a ""must-have"" in the home. The product was launched in 2005 primarily into the new home construction market at the height of the housing boom. PEARL quickly saw mass appeal in the channel and was recognized by Building Products magazine as one of the Top 100 Building Products for 2007. The housing decline in 2007-08 significantly impacted PEARL's traction in the market. The product saw a brief resurgence in the college and university housing community following the mass shooting tragedy at Virginia Tech in 2007. In 2009 PEARL entered a licensing and distribution agreement with Werner Ladder Company, the world's leading manufacturer and distributor of ladders, climbing equipment and ladder accessories.",cvent,v1397184918/5864be9e5946cb408fac35c849fe9b6f.gif,30be31c8-67a8-2cb5-2668-2e988f0130f8,organization,Cvent,male

There he led the development of a number of successful production vehicles and designed the Oldsmobile Aerotech speed-record vehicle in the mid-1980s, which set several world records.

He was named chief designer of the Oldsmobile Studio in 1989 before beginning a two-year assignment at Saturn in 1996, which led to an overseas assignment in Germany, where he worked on future global design programs.

Welburn was named director of GM’s Advanced Design organization in 1998. His team was responsible for the development of new and innovative vehicles for all GM brands, including a new generation of hydrogen fuel cell concepts. He was then appointed executive director of design, body-on-frame architectures, in 2002. In this position, he was responsible for the three truck studios at the GM Design Center in Warren.

Welburn’s passion for car design began at an early age in his hometown of Philadelphia. He was initially influenced by vehicles such as the Cadillac Cyclone concept and Chevrolet Corvettes during the late 1950s. At age 11, he wrote a letter to GM saying he wanted to be a car designer. The company wrote back, and recommended the steps he needed to take to achieve his dream.",general-motors,ks5xgyqpooxo3impttid,5087a047-80c5-4aa3-dfdf-30dd8ac88b5e,organization,General Motors,male

Smith is the former CEO and current executive chairman of Intuit Inc., co-founder of The Wing 2 Wing Foundation, chairman of Nordstrom’s board and sits on the board of directors of Momentive (formerly SurveyMonkey).   

Smith’s journey with Intuit began in 2003, when he joined the company as vice president and general manager of Intuit's Accountant Central and Developer Network in Plano, Texas. After three years in this role, Smith became the senior vice president and general manager of Intuit's Small Business Division and was responsible for the small business division’s product offerings, which included QuickBooks, Quicken and Payroll.

In 2008, Brad D. Smith became Intuit's CEO and held the position for 11 years. 

During his time as CEO, Smith transitioned the company from its original desktop financial software offerings to a global, cloud-based product and platform company. This move is widely considered his greatest accomplishment with the company. 

In 2019, Smith stepped down from his post as CEO, transitioning the position to Intuit’s current CEO, Sasan Goodarzi.

Shortly after stepping down, Smith co-founded The Wing 2 Wing Foundation with his wife, Alys. Each from small hometowns (Brad is from Kenova, West Virginia and Alys is from Akron, Ohio), the pair wanted to create economic opportunity and resources for young entrepreneurs. The organization’s goal is to advance the great equalizers of education and entrepreneurship in regions where individuals and communities have been overlooked and underserved. In doing so, they strive to champion human dignity and unleash human potential. 

Before Intuit, Smith was the senior vice president of Marketing and Business Development at ADP. Smith also held various sales, marketing and general management positions with Pepsi, 7-Up, and ADVO, Inc.

Smith earned a master's degree in management from Aquinas College in Michigan and a bachelor's degree in business administration from Marshall University in West Virginia. In an effort to give back to the community that built him, Smith and his wife started a $10 million scholarship fund at Marshall, and gifted $25 million to the university’s schools of business. The Smith family has also given West Virginia University a $25 million donation through their Wing 2 Wing foundation.

Today, Brad D. Smith lives in Menlo Park, California with his family.",intuit,cnkatwxghv5lwfgse0iv,fbef6457-9149-72cf-af57-7cfbe15c05f8,organization,Intuit,male

SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualtrics, provider of the world's leading insight platform, today announced the appointment of veteran Microsoft executive Zig Serafin as the company's chief operating officer. Serafin will relocate from Washington to Utah, to lead operations during a time of rapid growth and international expansion for Qualtrics.

""We are excited to bring an industry luminary of Zig's caliber on board as we continue growing aggressively,"" said Ryan Smith, co-founder and CEO of Qualtrics. ""Qualtrics is scaling at an incredible rate and there's no better person to help us add a new level of operational efficiency than Zig. He brings a wealth of experience developing products, scaling complex organizations, and building amazing teams.""

""This has been a very long and selective search and Ryan and I feel we've found the perfect partner in Zig,"" said Jared Smith, co-founder and acting COO of Qualtrics. ""Qualtrics is passing 1,200 employees, expanding product lines, and has started IPO planning. Zig is a phenomenal operator and will bring considerable experience leading cross-functional teams on a global scale. We couldn't be happier about having him join our team.""

Prior to joining Qualtrics, Serafin spent 17 years at Microsoft leading large teams and building multi-billion-dollar product lines. Most recently, Serafin was a corporate vice president with responsibility for Office 365 Skype for Business, which is used in 1.2 billion meetings per year in over 90 countries. Serafin also helped spearhead the development of Microsoft's artificial intelligence platform and personal assistant, Cortana, which today services more than 130 million monthly active users. Serafin previously served as general manager of Microsoft's Tellme Networks.

""I'm thrilled to join one of the world's most promising SaaS companies at a very exciting time,"" Serafin said.

I'm eager to bring my perspective and expertise to bear at Qualtrics and partner with Jared and Ryan.""

As CEO, Mr. Vanek is principal of the data collection industry’s leading survey software company.

He continues to provide solutions for companies to collect, centralize, and distribute data as a means of reaching informed business decisions. His strategic vision for the company is to establish SurveyGizmo’s rightful place as the leader in the survey software industry and drive the industry forward. 

SurveyGizmo, a 100% bootstrapped company, is proudly celebrating 10 years of service and over $13 Million in revenue. Under Mr. Vanek’s leadership, in 2016, SurveyGizmo was named Editor’s Choice for PC Magazine, and voted #1 in survey software satisfaction for the G2 Crowd’s Fall Grid Report.

Prior to SurveyGizmo, Mr. Vanek first became interested in building software in 1995 during his year of service for AmeriCorps. While working in the homeless shelter there, he noticed a need for greater efficiency and built a software package to help manage clothing and service distribution. 

In 1997, Mr. Vanek joined the Digital Consulting Institute, automating processes for their in-house travel agency and marketing teams. He worked closely with the marketers there and developed a content management system for the company. 

In 1999, Mr. Vanek left DCI and began work on his own marketing automation software company, but the platform was ahead of its time and market. 

In 2002, Mr. Vanek started his consulting company, CVanek Studios, where he created and sold a co-registration brokerage software package.

In 2011, Philip joined Thomson Reuters, where he successfully turned around the flagship financial desktop, Eikon.

A technologist at heart and by training, Tom has spent much of his career involved in the development of video, voice and data broadband technology for the satellite, wireless and cable television industries.  

During the 1990’s, Tom was instrumental in the creation of patented technology supporting what is known as a DOCSIS™ cable modem. This specification became a global ITU standard with over 100 million modems deployed worldwide by manufacturers such as Motorola, Cisco, Toshiba, Samsung and Broadcom.

In 1998, Tom co-founded WildBlue Communications with the purpose of extending the DOCSIS™ technology into the satellite world and thus making the benefits of broadband available to the 15-20 million homes in the US that would not receive it otherwise.  WildBlue became the second largest satellite-based broadband service provider in the world, serving over half a million consumers and small businesses without alternative access to broadband technologies such as DSL and cable modem. The company built and launched three of its own special purpose satellites and deployed a nationwide consumer service.

Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, California to Joanne Simpson and a Syrian father. Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View, California then adopted him. In 1972, Jobs graduated from Homestead High School in Cupertino, California and enrolled in Reed College in Portland, Oregon. One semester later, he dropped out, later taking up the study of philosophy and foreign cultures.

Steve Jobs had a deep-seated interest in technology, so he took up a job at [Atari Inc,](/organization/atari) then a leading manufacturer of video games. He struck a friendship with fellow designer [Steve Wozniak](/person/steve-wozniak) and attended Homebrew Computer Club meetings with him. 

After saving up some money, Jobs took off for India in the search of enlightenment. Once he returned, he convinced Wozniak to quit his job at [Hewlett Packard](/organization/hewlett-packard) to join him in his venture that concerned personal computers. They sold items like scientific calculators to raise seed capital. 

In 1976, Jobs and Wozniak founded [Apple Computer](/organization/apple) in the Jobs family garage. The first personal computer was sold for $666.66. By 1980, Apple had already released three improved versions of the personal computer. It had a wildly successful IPO, which made both founders millionaires many times over. 

A tiff with the Apple's Board of Directors and John Scully led to Jobs' resignation. Steve Jobs decided that he wanted to change the hardware industry. The company was called [NeXTStep](/organization/next), which produced the NeXT Computer. The machine was a commercial washout but helped with future work in object-oriented programming, PostScript, and magneto-optical devices. Jobs returned to his original company after Apple acquired NeXT in 1996.

Steve Jobs also started [Pixar](/organization/pixar), which has produced multiple blockbuster films, including Toy Story (1995); A Bug's Life (1998); Toy Story 2 (1999); Monsters, Inc. (2001); Finding Nemo (2003); and The Incredibles (2004).

In 2004, Jobs was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his pancreas, which was successfully treated. 

Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple on August 24, 2011 and subsequently assumed the role of Chairman of the Board. 

On October 5, 2011, Jobs passed away.",apple-inc,tyspbwezdljrai4zfgeg,2d62fec3-1058-462f-a244-02e3ce3c34a0,organization,Apple Inc.,male

He also remains the primary architect for JMP®software.
Sall joined Jim Goodnight and two others in 1976 to establish SAS. He designed, developed and documented many of the earliest analytical procedures while also leading research and development efforts. In the late 1980s, Sall noticed a niche to fill for researchers and engineers whose jobs didn't revolve solely around statistical analysis. JMP launched in 1989 to dynamically link statistical analysis with the graphical capabilities of Macintosh computers. Now running on Windows as well, JMP continues to play an important role in modeling processes across industries as a desktop data visualization and analysis tool. It also provides a visual interface to SAS® software.

The goal of JMP, Sall said, is to make statistical modeling as friendly, accessible and informative as possible, and to increase the efficiency of experimentation. “The value of statistics is realized when it is translated, taught and delivered with accessible computing environments to the scientists and analysts who use it,” he added.

Sall is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest general scientific society. Reflecting his passion for global conservation and environmental issues, he serves on the World Wildlife Fund board, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History advisory board, and is a former board member of The Nature Conservancy. Sall also is a former trustee of North Carolina State University, where he studied graduate-level statistics. In 1997, he and his wife, Ginger, joined Jim and Ann Goodnight in founding Cary Academy, which integrates technology into all facets of education for students in grades six to 12.
Sall earned a bachelor's degree in history from Beloit College and a master’s degree in economics from Northern Illinois University (NIU). Both NIU and NC State awarded him honorary doctorates.

He strongly believes that a highly effective sales organization drives consistent, global revenue growth by demonstrating value to its customers.
“Helping businesses and organizations tap into the value of analytics so they can gain new insights and achieve unexpected results is very rewarding,” said Lisi. “My job is to continue empowering the global SAS sales teams to understand the challenges our customers face and provide them with the right tools and resources that allow all of us to be successful.”

Prior to his current position, Lisi served as Senior Vice President of SAS Sales and Global Field Operations where he developed and executed results-focused strategies and programs for the company’s more than 3,000 sales and operations professionals. Prior to that he was Vice President of SAS Americas, where he was instrumental in growing and developing the organization in the United States, Canada and Latin America. He led the development efforts for the US Customer Loyalty and Retention team and its use of a customer development lifecycle model to ensure SAS remains current with customers’ needs, and to ensure customers receive the maximum value from their SAS investment. The end result of this strategy is a continued culture of excellence for SAS and its customers.

As Vice President, Lisi also led the creation of a volume sales channel in the US to accelerate both sales and renewal revenue growth. Since its inception, US Inside Sales has generated more than $150 million in new revenue and established relationships with over 2,700 new customers.

Lisi began his SAS career in 2003 as the Vice President of Sales for SAS Canada, where he drove year-over-year revenue growth until his departure in 2005. From 2005 to 2007, Lisi acted as Managing Director for EMC Canada, then President and CEO of AudienceView, a next-generation ticketing company. In both positions, he drove strategy and deployment of effective sales and services models, achieved significant growth, and exceeded quarterly targets. He returned to SAS in 2007 as interim Country Manager for SAS Brazil, where he aligned the organizational structure to support the go-to-market strategy.

Lisi has more than 30 years of technology sales experience with companies like IBM and Xerox, where he held both sales and management roles. He holds a bachelor’s degree in history and Italian literature, and a master’s in business administration from the University of Toronto. He currently splits his time between Cary, North Carolina and Toronto, Ontario.

Parker joined SAS in 1993 with a diversified financial background, including international operations. He places strong emphasis on integrity, quality and customer service. His management style is one of collaboration and transparency, partnering across divisions to reach the goals of a $3 billion-plus global company. Under Parker’s leadership, the finance organization uses SAS financial and business software solutions, which also provide valuable insights to CFOs and CEOs of SAS customers.

In 2011, Triangle Business Journal named Parker CFO of the Year. In an interview with the Journal, he spoke about how he contributes to SAS’ growth. “Working for a privately held company, I have the luxury of spending most of my time trying to look ahead to where and how we are going to grow, rather than reporting on where we have been,” said Parker. “Growth for technology businesses like SAS is fueled by innovation. In order to continue growth and produce innovative products, you must invest. It is important for a CFO to take care of company profits and make wise spending choices that lead to future growth.”

Parker is a member of the Wall Street Journal's CFO Network. He graduated from the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School and is a CPA.

His group is currently using a combination of large-scale neurophysiology, brain imaging, optogenetic methods, and high-throughput computational simulations to understand the neuronal mechanisms and fundamental cortical computations that underlie the construction of these powerful image representations. They aim to use this understanding to inspire and develop new machine vision systems, to provide a basis for new neural prosthetics (brain-machine interfaces) to restore or augment lost senses, and to provide a foundation upon which the community can understand how high-level visual representation is altered in human conditions such as agnosia, autism, and dyslexia.",massachusetts-institute-of-technology-mit,m4jzvbjvtbxkoo7wpwt6,6599f877-7c83-0c47-b05b-dbedd3db7b3a,organization,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,male
