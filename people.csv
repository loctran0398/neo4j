This included the company's entry into the direct merchant acquiring business serving hundreds of thousands of businesses and into a leading prepaid services provider, supporting millions of underserved consumers who do not have access to traditional financial services.

Woods has been the catalyst in TSYS' vision to be the leading global payments solutions provider by driving innovation to improve lives and businesses across the world by putting people at the center of payments. Under Woods leadership, the company introduced its brand promise, People-Centered Payments, which is based on the belief that payments should revolve around people, not the other way around.

Woods started his career at Columbus Bank and Trust Company (Columbus, Ga.) in 1970, working part-time in the bankcard department and eventually becoming a vice president. He left the company in 1977 to become a senior vice president for card services with United American Bank, Knoxville, TN. In 1979 he joined AmSouth Bank in Birmingham, AL, as senior vice president of Card Services, and in 1982 became senior vice president of Consumer Lending. He rejoined TSYS in 1987 and was involved in directing the company's international expansion, strategic planning activities, negotiations with major clients, and the continual improvement of TS2, the company's core issuing payments engine.

Woods is chairman of the TSYS Board of Directors, and also serves on the Board of Directors for several civic organizations as well, including the YMCA of Metropolitan Columbus (Ga.), West Georgia Honor Flight and the Greater Columbus Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees for Columbus State University and the River Center for the Performing Arts in Columbus, Georgia.

The overall Wipro group revenues are $ 9 billion.

Premji has been driven by one basic idea – to build an organization deeply committed to Values, with the firm belief that success in business eventually but inevitably follows. Unflinching commitment to Values continues to remain at the core of Wipro. Premji strongly believes that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things when organized into highly charged teams, and takes keen personal interest in developing leaders and teams.
Wipro’s business success has been driven by keeping the customer at the core of everything it does. Combining its deep expertise in technology with an equally clear understanding of customer industries, Wipro attempts to deliver business value to customers consistently. The consistency is driven by its pioneering efforts in service quality and predictability, through methodologies like Six Sigma, PCMM and Lean. The underlying tenets that drive this overall culture are that of speed, simplicity and excellence.

Premji firmly believes that business organizations have a social responsibility not only to employ ethical, fair and ecologically sensitive business practices but also to actively engage with fundamental societal issues. Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (in India) and Wipro STEM Fellowships (in the US) are initiatives deeply involved in trying to improve quality of school education, while the Wipro Cares program engages with local community causes. Mission 10X works to improve quality of engineering college education. In 2001, Premji established and personally endowed the Azim Premji Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, with a vision of enhancing quality and equity in the public school education system in India, to build a better society. The Azim Premji Foundation works in 7 states of India which have over 300,000 schools. In 2011, the Foundation established the Azim Premji University, which is focused on teaching and research programs in Education and other areas of Human Development.

Over the years, Azim Premji has received numerous honors and accolades, which he considers as recognitions for Team Wipro. BusinessWeek featured him on their cover of the October 2003 issue with the sobriquet India’s Tech King and listed him amongst the top 30 entrepreneurs in world history in July 2007. In October 2005, Financial Times included him in a global list of 25 people dramatically reshaping the way people live, work or think. Time listed him amongst the world’s 100 most influential people in April 2004 and again April 2011, citing his contribution to improving the public education system in India. He was named by Fortune (August 2003) as one of the 25 most powerful business leaders outside the US, by Forbes (March 2003) as one of ten people globally with most power to effect change, and by the Journal of Foreign Policy (November 2011) as amongst the top global thinkers.

Premji became the first Indian recipient of the Faraday Medal and has been conferred honorary doctorates by the Michigan State University and Wesleyan University (in the US), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Roorkee and Kharagpur amongst others. He is a member of the Indo-UK, Indo-French CEO forums and a member of the Indo-Japan Business Leaders’ Forum. The Republic of France bestowed upon him the Legion of Honor and Forbes India honored him with its inaugural Outstanding Philanthropist of the Year in November 2012. He was conferred in January 2011 with Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award in India. In September 2013 Premji received All India Management Association (AIMA) Managing India Award as the Corporate Citizen of the Year for his inspiring business values and his contribution to society. He was honored with the Asian Business Leaders Award by Asia House (UK) in October 2013 for his impressive business credentials and his significant efforts to inspire a commitment in others to improving society. In December 2013, Economic Times bestowed Mr. Premji with Life Time Achievement Award.",wipro,ygi0uferwwy6yie5i2f3,ac6ef54a-1f35-a468-2001-f04dd3fc035e,organization,Wipro Technologies,male

Ric co-founded Red Ventures in 2000, just days before the dot-com bubble burst. The company weathered the storm and by 2007 it was ranked 4th on the Inc. 500 list.

In 2009, Elias was a survivor of Flight 1549, an event which drastically changed his life and led to his widely viewed TED Talk “3 things I learned while my plane crashed.” Elias is cited as aspiring to create the “Google of the East Coast” within his company’s culture and facilities.

Ric's leadership style earned him noteworthy recognition in 2011, when he was named an Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year. His inspirational views on both business and family have been featured on CNN, TED Talks and MSNBC.

Ric Elias is the co-founder and CEO of Red Ventures, a portfolio of digital companies headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. With over 3,000 employees in 10 US cities, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Brazil, Red Ventures’s digital platform spans across many industries, including home services, financial services, health services, education, and entertainment. Through its influential brands, strategic partnerships, and powerful technology platform, Red Ventures connects millions of people to premium content, intuitive digital experiences, and consumer advice to help make life’s most important decisions.

Over the last decade, Red Ventures has compounded growth at over 30%. In 2010, General Atlantic made a strategic investment in the company, and in 2015 Silver Lake also joined as a shareholder. Ric has cultivated an award-winning and technology-centric company culture, ranking as one of Charlotte’s “Best Places to Work” for ten years in a row.

A native of Puerto Rico, Ric graduated from Boston College and earned his MBA from Harvard Business School. He co-founded Red Ventures in 2000, months before the dot-com bubble burst. The company weathered the storm; by 2007 it was ranked 4th on the Inc. 500 list. Ric’s leadership style has earned him noteworthy recognition; in 2011, he was named an Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year, and in 2016 he was inducted into the Carolinas Entrepreneur Hall of Fame.

In 2009, Ric survived Flight 1549, also known as the “Miracle on the Hudson,” an event which changed his life and led to his widely viewed TED Talk “3 Things I Learned While My Plane Crashed.” In 2019, he launched a podcast, “3 Things with Ric Elias,” where he shares conversations and insights with top business leaders, athletes, and remarkable guests.

In addition to being deeply committed to his family and Red Ventures, Ric is passionate about creating economic mobility opportunities for underserved groups who have the motivation and work ethic to succeed. In 2013, he founded and funded what is now Road to Hire, a 501(c)(3) that connects young adults with on-ramps to professional development and high-earning careers. Programs provided through the Road to Hire platform include career-readiness classes in Charlotte Mecklenberg Title 1 high schools, digital marketing courses at Johnson C. Smith University, on-the-job training and placement with top employers in Charlotte , and scholarships for high-performing undocumented students seeking college degrees.
